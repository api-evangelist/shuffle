description: 'Shuffle started as a project in mid-2019 because of a few
  automation related problems that needed more attention in the CERT/SIRT
  community. Available automation solutions in the security industry are trying
  to do everything at once; handle tickets, indicators, threat intel and much
  more in a single platform, while our goal is to build the best solution to fit
  all your existing tools following the Unix philosophy: "Do One Thing and Do It
  Well".'
