      Shuffle started as a project in mid-2019 because of a few automation
      related problems that needed more attention in the CERT/SIRT community.
      Available automation solutions in the security industry are trying to do
      everything at once; handle tickets, indicators, threat intel and much more
      in a single platform, while our goal is to build the best solution to fit
      all your existing tools following the Unix philosophy Do One Thing and Do
      It Well.
