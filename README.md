Shuffle started as a project in mid-2019 because of a few automation related problems that needed more attention in the CERT/SIRT community. Available automation solutions in the security industry are trying to do everything at once; handle tickets, indicators, threat intel and much more in a single platform, while our goal is to build the best solution to fit all your existing tools following the Unix philosophy: "Do One Thing and Do It Well".
